    <ol>
        <li>Bring a large pot of lightly salted <em>water to a boil</em>. Cook <strong>spaghetti</strong> in boiling water, stirring occasionally, until tender yet firm to the bite, about<em> 12 minutes</em>. Drain,toss spaghetti with<em>1 tablespoon olive oil</em>, and set aside.</li>
        <p>   </p>
        <li>Place diced bacon in a large skillet over medium heat; cook and stir until evenly browned, about 10 minutes. Drain bacon on paper towels, reserving 2 tablespoons bacon fat in the skillet.</li>
        <p>   </p>
        <li>Add 1 tablespoon olive oil to bacon fat in the skillet. Add chopped onion and cook over medium heat until onion is translucent. Add minced garlic and cook until fragrant, about 1 minute.  </li>
        <p>   </p>
        <li>Return cooked bacon to the skillet; add cooked spaghetti. Toss to coat and heat through, adding more olive oil if it seems dry or sticks together. Add beaten eggs and cook, tossing constantly with tongs or a large fork, until eggs are barely set. Quickly add 1/2 cup Parmesan cheese and toss again. Season with salt and pepper (remember that bacon and Parmesan are very salty).</li>
        <p>    </p>
        <li>Serve warm with chopped parsley sprinkled on top and extra Parmesan cheese at the table.</li>
    </ol>
